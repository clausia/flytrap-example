# Tensor Diagrams with D3### by Claudia Zendejas-MoralesTo use this mini library that allows to draw tensor diagrams, follow the next specification.To create a diagram it is necessary to include `tensordiagrams.js` and call the function:```drawDiagram (tensors, contractions, lines, "id_div_for_diagram", width, height, initial_color);```where- `tensors` [array]: indicates the nodes to draw, to indicate that there are no tensors send `null` to the function- `contractions` [array]: indicates the contractions of indices to draw, to indicate that there is no contraction send `null` to the function- `lines` [array]: single lines (without nodes) to draw, to indicate that there are no lines send `null` to the function- `id_div_for_diagram` [string]: is the name of the ID of the div in which the diagram will be placed- `width` [integer]: width of the diagram in pixels- `height` [integer]: height of the diagram in pixels- `initial_color` [integer] (optional): index where the colors for the nodes should start at#### Diagram elementsA node is specified with the following arguments:```{ x: 1,   y: 1,   name: "A",   shape: "circle"(default)|"dot"|"asterisk"|"square"|"triangleUp"|"triangleDown"|"triangleLeft"|"triangleRight"|"rectangle",  labPos: "up"(default)|"rightup"|"right"|"rightdown"|"down"|"leftdown"|"left"|"leftup",  idEqPart: "id_div_to_highlight"(optional),  showLabel: true(default)|false,  color: "#FFFFFF"(optional),  size: 35(optional),    indices: [	{ pos: "left"(default)|"right"|"up"|"down"|, 	  name: "j",    },  ]},```**Note**: if an argument has a default value, then the argument is optional.A contraction is specified with the following arguments:A line is specified with the following arguments:
