# Flytrap examples### by Claudia Zendejas-MoralesHere are examples using ⟨𝜑|𝜓⟩.vue ([bra-ket-vue](https://github.com/Quantum-Game/bra-ket-vue)) and [Quantum Tensors](https://github.com/Quantum-Game/quantum-tensors), in order to apply to an internship at Quantum Flytrap.The first example shows the effects of applying some gates to a qubit, as well as the matrix representation of these gates. A QuantumTensors `Circuit` is used as well as `Gates`, and with the help of ⟨𝜑|𝜓⟩.vue visualizations of the states are shown.The second example explains the quantum teleportation protocol, with the help of a QuantumTensors `Circuit` and gates that are modifying the quantum state, it includes an explanation of what is happening during the steps of the protocol. BraKetVue is also used to show the states through the steps.These examples have been generated with *RMarkdown* and *Vue*.
