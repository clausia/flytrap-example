# Flytrap examples
### by Claudia Zendejas-Morales


Here are examples using RMarkdown, Vue.js, ⟨𝜑|𝜓⟩.vue ([bra-ket-vue](https://github.com/Quantum-Game/bra-ket-vue)) and [Quantum Tensors](https://github.com/Quantum-Game/quantum-tensors), in order to colaborate with Quantum Flytrap.

The first example shows the effects of applying some gates to a qubit, as well as the matrix representation of these gates. A QuantumTensors `Circuit` is used as well as `Gates`, and with the help of ⟨𝜑|𝜓⟩.vue visualizations of the states are shown. Working example [here](https://claudiazm.xyz/flytrap-example/).

The second example explains the quantum teleportation protocol, with the help of a QuantumTensors `Circuit` and gates that are modifying the quantum state, it includes an explanation of what is happening during the steps of the protocol. BraKetVue is also used to show the states through the steps. Working example [here](https://claudiazm.xyz/flytrap-example/teleportation.html).
